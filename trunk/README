This is an implementation of the Google Pregel programming model using MPI and C++ templates.
You are welcome to try it out.
You can write your application by modifying the test programs in the apps directory.

Any comments or suggestions go to chuntao.hong@gmail.com.

If you are interested in developing the code, please please contact me. I am tired of doing it alone.
